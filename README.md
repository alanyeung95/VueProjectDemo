# Q & A
## Q1: What is ESLint and why we need to use it?
## A1: Linting tools like ESLint allow developers to discover problems with their JavaScript code without executing it. The primary reason ESLint was created was to allow developers to create their own linting rules

## Q2: Why we need to use typescript rather than pure javascript?
## A2: Typescript can let use to define an interface and it will do a type validation during compilation. For example, it can help us to debug after we update our schema

## Q3: What is Vuetify?
## A3: Vuetif is the #1 component library for Vue.js and has been in active development since 2016





# Notes
## Note to use Vuetify
```
